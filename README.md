# Simple_JS
This is a repository to show little codes that I do while I'm learning JS

GuessNumber: Little game where you have to guess a random number between 1 and 100

RockPaperScissors: The traditional game of rock paper scissors where I developed just the algorithm in order to work with conditionals, loops and functions in JS. 

ManipulatingDom: Just few lines of code to show how to change the DOM with JS. Also is added how EventListener works.
